          <span class="font_gray" style="font-weight: normal">This User Agreement ("Agreement") governs our
            relationship with users and others who interact with ScholarMate. By using or accessing ScholarMate, you
            agree to this Agreement.</span><br />
          <br /> 1. INTRODUCTION.
        </P>
        <P class=outTitle2>
          <b>A. Principles.</b><br /> The mission of ScholarMate is to connect the world’s researchers and academic
          scholars to enable them to conduct research activities more efficiently. To achieve our Mission, we make
          services available through our platforms, to help you and other researchers meet, exchange ideas, learn, make
          friends, find opportunities or employees, share research resources, work, and make decisions in groups.
          Achieving these principles should be constrained only by limitations of law, technology, and evolving social
          norms. We therefore establish these Principles as the foundation of the rights and responsibilities of those
          within the ScholarMate Service. <br />
          <br /> <b>B. Scope and Intent.</b><br /> You agree that by registering on ScholarMate, or by using the our
          website or other information provided as part of the ScholarMate services (collectively “ScholarMate” or the
          “Services”), you are entering into a legally binding agreement with CITINet Systems Limited based on the terms
          of this User Agreement and the ScholarMate Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference
          (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”) and become a ScholarMate user (“User”). If you are using
          ScholarMate on behalf of a company or other legal entity, such entity may have a separate agreement with us,
          but you are nevertheless individually bound by this Agreement. If you do not want to become a User, you shall
          NOT conclude the Agreement, and shall NOT click “Register” and do not access, view, download or otherwise use
          any ScholarMate webpage, information or services. By becoming a User you acknowledge that you have read and
          understood the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that you agree to be bound by all of its provisions.
          Please note that the ScholarMate User Agreement and Privacy Policy are also collectively referred to as
          ScholarMate’s “Terms of Service.”
        </P>
        <P class=outTitle1>2. YOUR OBLIGATIONS.</P>
        <P class=outTitle2>
          <b>A. Applicable laws and this Agreement</b><br /> You must comply with all applicable laws, the Agreement,
          as may be amended from time to time with or without advance notice, and the policies and processes explained
          in the following sections: <br />
          <br />1. DOs and DON’Ts; (Section 10)<br /> 2. Complaints Regarding Content Posted on the ScholarMate

          <br /> <b>B. License and warranty for your submissions to ScholarMate.</b><br /> You own the information you
          provide ScholarMate under this Agreement, and may request its deletion at any time, unless you have shared
          information or content with others and they have not deleted it, or it was copied or stored by other users.<br />
          <br /> For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like research writings, articles,
          documents, files, photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give us the following permission, subject
          to the privacy policy: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, fully paid up
          and worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with ScholarMate ("IP License").
          You also grant us the same rights to copy, prepare derivative works of, improve, distribute, publish, remove,
          retain, add, process, analyze, use and commercialize, in any way now known or in the future discovered, any
          information you provide, directly or indirectly to ScholarMate, including but not limited to any user
          generated content, ideas, concepts, techniques or data to the services, you submit to ScholarMate, without any
          further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or to any third parties. <br />
          <br /> This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been
          shared with others, and they have not deleted it. Any information you submit to ScholarMate is at your own
          risk of loss as noted in Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement. <br />
          <br /> By providing information to us, you represent and warrant that you are entitled to submit the
          information and that the information is accurate, not confidential, and not in violation of any contractual
          restrictions or other third party rights. It is your responsibility to keep your ScholarMate profile
          information accurate and updated. <br />
          <br /> <b>C. Payment</b><br /> You must pay the appropriate subscription fees for use of the “Paid Service”
          and any modules purchased, plus all applicable sales, use or similar taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you
          may, if you so choose, elect to have a limited trial period of the Service. At the end of the trial, you must
          pay the appropriate fee to retain the right to use the Service. <br />
          <br /> <b>D. Service Eligibility.</b><br /> To be eligible to use the Service, you must meet the following
          criteria and represent and warrant that you: (1) are 18 years of age or older; (2) are not currently
          restricted from the Services, or not otherwise prohibited from having a ScholarMate account, (3) are not a
          competitor of ScholarMate or are not using the Services for reasons that are in competition with ScholarMate;
          (4) will only maintain one ScholarMate account at any given time; (5) have full power and authority to enter
          into this Agreement and doing so will not violate any other agreement to which you are a party; (6) will not
          violate any rights of ScholarMate, including intellectual property rights such as copyright or trademark
          rights; and (7) agree to provide at your cost all equipment, software, and internet access necessary to use
          the Services.<br />
          <br /> <b>E. Indemnification.</b><br /> You indemnify us and hold us harmless for all damages, losses and
          costs (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) related to all third party claims,
          charges, and investigations, caused by (1) your failure to comply with this Agreement, including, without
          limitation, your submission of content that violates third party rights or applicable laws, (2) any content
          you submit to the Services, and (3) any activity in which you engage on or through ScholarMate. <br />
          <br /> <b>F. Sign-In Credentials.</b><br /> You agree to: (1) Keep your password secure and confidential;
          (2) not permit others to use your account; (3) refrain from using other Users’ accounts; (4) refrain from
          selling, trading, or otherwise transferring your ScholarMate account to another party; and (5) refrain from

          responsible for anything that happens through your account until you close down your account or prove that
          your account security was compromised due to no fault of your own. To close your account, please contact us
          directly. <br />
          <br /> <b>G. Notify us of acts contrary to the Agreement.</b><br /> If you believe that you are entitled or
          obligated to act contrary to this Agreement under any mandatory law, you agree to provide us with detailed and
          substantiated explanation of your reasons in writing at least 30 days before you act contrary to this
          Agreement, to allow us to assess whether we may, at our sole discretion, provide an alternative remedy for the
          situation, though we are under no obligation to do so. <br />
          <br /> <b>H. Notifications and Service Messages.</b><br /> For purposes of service messages and notices
          about the Services to you, notice shall consist of an email from ScholarMate to an email address associated
          with your account, even if we have other contact information. You also agree that ScholarMate may communicate
          with you through your ScholarMate account or through other means including email, mobile number, telephone, or
          delivery services about your ScholarMate account or services associated with ScholarMate. You acknowledge and
          agree that we shall have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to do so maintain accurate
          contact or other information, including, but not limited to, your failure to receive critical information
          about the Service. <br />
          <br /> <b>I. User-to-User Communication and Sharing (ScholarMate Groups, Answers, Updates, etc.).</b><br />
          ScholarMate offers various forums and other User-to-User features such as Group Messaging where you can post
          your observations and comments on designated topics. ScholarMate also enables sharing of information by
          allowing users to post updates, including links to news articles and other information to their profile. Ideas
          you post and information you share may be seen and used by other Users, and ScholarMate cannot guarantee that
          other Users will not use the ideas and information that you share on ScholarMate. Therefore, if you have an
          idea or information that you would like to keep confidential and/or don’t want others to use, or that is
          subject to third party rights that may be infringed by your sharing it, do not post it to ScholarMate Group or
          elsewhere on ScholarMate. ScholarMate IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A USER’S MISUSE OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY
          CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST IN ANY SCHOLARMATE COMMUNITY FORUMS.<br />
          <br /> <b>J. Privacy.</b><br /> You should carefully read ScholarMate’s full Privacy Policy before deciding
          to become a User as it governs our treatment of any information, including personally identifiable information
          you submit to us. Please note that certain information, statements, data and content (such as photographs)
          which you may submit to ScholarMate, or groups you choose to join might, or are likely to, reveal your gender,
          ethnic origin, nationality, age, religion and/or sexual orientation, and/or other personal information about
          you. You acknowledge that your submission of any information, statements, data, and content to us is voluntary
          on your part. <br />
          <br /> <b>K. Export Control.</b><br /> Your use of ScholarMate services, including our software, is subject
          to export and re-export control laws. You shall not — directly or indirectly — sell, export, re-export,
          transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any software or service to any end-user without obtaining the
          required authorizations from the appropriate government authorities.
        </P>
        <P class=outTitle1>3. YOUR RIGHTS.</P>
        <P class=outTitle2>On the condition that you comply with all your obligations under this Agreement, we grant
          you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicenseable right to access, through a generally
          available web browser or mobile device or application (but not through scraping, spidering, crawling or other
          technology or software used to access data without the express written consent of ScholarMate), view
          information and use the Services that we provide on ScholarMate and in accordance with this Agreement. Any
          other use of ScholarMate contrary to our mission and purpose (such as seeking to connect to someone you do not
          know or trust, or to use information gathered from ScholarMate commercially unless expressly authorized by
          ScholarMate) is strictly prohibited and a violation of this Agreement. We reserve all rights not expressly
          granted in this Agreement, including, without limitation, title, ownership, intellectual property rights, and
          all other rights and interest in ScholarMate and all related items.</P>
        <P class=outTitle1>4. OUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.</P>
        <P class=outTitle2>
          <b>A. Services Availability.</b><br /> You are allowed to access ScholarMate as it may exist and be available
          on any given day and have no other obligations, except as expressly stated in this Agreement. We may modify,
          replace, refuse access to, suspend or discontinue ScholarMate, partially or entirely, or change and modify
          prices for all or part of the Services in our sole discretion. All of these changes shall be effective upon
          their posting on our site or by direct communication to you unless otherwise noted. ScholarMate further
          reserves the right to withhold, remove and or discard any content available as part of your account, with or
          without notice if deemed by ScholarMate to be contrary to this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, ScholarMate
          has no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content that you or other Users provide when
          using the Services. <br />
          <br /> <b>B. Third Parties.</b><br /> ScholarMate may include links to third party web sites (“Third Party
          Sites”) on www.scholarmate.com, and elsewhere. You are responsible for evaluating whether you want to access
          or use a Third Party Site or Platform Application. You should review any applicable terms and/or privacy
          policy of a Third Party before using it or sharing any information with it, because you may give the operator
          permission to use your information in ways we would not. <br />
          <br /> ScholarMate is not responsible for and does not endorse any features, content, advertising, products
          or other materials on or available from Third Party Sites. ScholarMate also does not screen, audit, or endorse
          Platform Applications. Accordingly, if you decide to access Third Party Sites, you do so at your own risk and
          agree that your use of any Platform Application is on an “as-is” basis without any warranty, and that this
          Agreement does not apply to your use of any Third Party Site. <br />
          <br /> Please note: If you allow Third Party Site to authenticate to or connect with your ScholarMate
          account, that application or website can access information on ScholarMate related to you and your
          connections. <br />
          <br /> <b>C. Disclosure of User Information.</b><br /> You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may
          access, preserve, and disclose your registration and any other information you provide if required to do so by
          law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary in our
          opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including but not limited to civil and criminal subpoenas, court
          orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of
          the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a User, individual, or government agency; (4)
          respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ScholarMate,
          our Users or the public. <br />
          <br /> <b>D. Connections and Interactions with other Users.</b><br /> You are solely responsible for your
          interactions with other Users. ScholarMate may limit the number of connections you may have to other Users and
          may, in certain circumstances, prohibit you from contacting other Users through use of the Services or
          otherwise limit your use of the Services. ScholarMate reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor
          disputes between you and other members and to restrict, suspend, or close your account if ScholarMate
          determines, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary to enforce this Agreement.
        </P>
        <P class=outTitle1>5. DISCLAIMER.</P>
        <P class=outTitle2>
          SOME COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED TERMS IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND
          AS A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. DO NOT RELY ON SCHOLARMATE, ANY INFORMATION
          THEREIN, OR ITS CONTINUATION. WE PROVIDE THE PLATFORM FOR SCHOLARMATE AND ALL INFORMATION AND SERVICES ON AN
          “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS. <br />
          <br /> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, SCHOLARMATE DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED
          WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
          A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED OR HARMED BY SCHOLARMATE OR ANYTHING
          RELATED TO SCHOLARMATE, YOU MAY CLOSE YOUR SCHOLARMATE ACCOUNT AND TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH
          SECTION 7 (“TERMINATION”) AND SUCH TERMINATION SHALL BE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. <br />
          <br /> SCHOLARMATE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES FOR THE DELIVERY OF ANY
          MESSAGES (SUCH AS INMAILS, POSTING OF ANSWERS OR TRANSMISSION OF ANY OTHER USER GENERATED CONTENT) SENT
          THROUGH SCHOLARMATE TO ANYONE. IN ADDITION, WE NEITHER WARRANT NOR REPRESENT THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE WILL
          NOT INFRINGE THE RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. ANY MATERIAL, SERVICE, OR TECHNOLOGY DESCRIBED OR USED ON THE
          WEBSITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES WHO HAVE LICENSED SUCH MATERIAL
          TO US, SERVICE, OR TECHNOLOGY. <br />
          <br /> SCHOLARMATE DOES NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSONS SUBSCRIBING TO ITS
          SERVICES, NOR DOES IT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO MONITOR THE USE OF ITS SERVICES BY OTHER USERS OF THE COMMUNITY;
          THEREFORE, SCHOLARMATE DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR ANY OTHER MISUSE OF YOUR IDENTITY OR
          INFORMATION. <br />
          <br /> SCHOLARMATE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES IT PROVIDES WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR
          ERRORS IN FUNCTIONING. IN PARTICULAR, THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES MAY BE INTERRUPTED DUE TO MAINTENANCE,
          UPDATES, OR SYSTEM OR NETWORK FAILURES. SCHOLARMATE DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY ANY SUCH
          INTERRUPTION OR ERRORS IN FUNCTIONING. FURTHERMORE, SCHOLARMATE DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY
          MALFUNCTIONING, IMPOSSIBILITY OF ACCESS, OR POOR USE CONDITIONS OF THE SCHOLARMATE SITE DUE TO INAPPROPRIATE
          EQUIPMENT, DISTURBANCES RELATED TO INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO THE SATURATION OF THE INTERNET NETWORK, AND
          FOR ANY OTHER REASON.
        </P>
        <P class=outTitle1>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</P>
        <P class=outTitle2>
          <b>SOME COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS
            A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</b> <br />
          <br /> Neither ScholarMate nor any of our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, employees, shareholders, or
          directors (“ScholarMate Affiliates”) shall be liable for any damages or loss, including lost profits, loss of
          use, or special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, caused to any person as a result of
          the user of the Service or any of the content or other materials on accessed through or downloaded from
          ScholarMate, regardless of whether the possibility of such damages was foreseeable. This limitation of
          liability shall apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract, tort, statute or any other
          legal theory, (2) we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited
          remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose.<br />
          <br /> The Service is licensed and not sold. Continued access to the Service depends on the renewal of the
          Service license by Customer. ScholarMate will not be liable for loss of data due to non-renewal of the Service
          license or otherwise.
        </P>
        <P class=outTitle1>7. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE DATABASES</P>
        <P class=outTitle2>Customer acknowledges that the Service is proprietary to ScholarMate and that the Service
          shall remain the exclusive property of ScholarMate and that Customer has no rights therein other than as set
          forth herein. ScholarMate has copyrighted the Service and all rights are reserved. Customer shall not
          duplicate, distribute, sell, commercially exploit, create derivative works from, reverse compile or otherwise
          make available the Service to any third party.</P>
        <P class=outTitle1>8. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</P>
        <P class=outTitle2>You acknowledge that there are certain system requirements that are necessary in order to
          use the Service, and you are financially and technically responsible for ensuring that these requirements are
          met. These system requirements are (a) full access to the Internet (TCPIP) and (b) a World Wide Web browser,
          either Netscape (version 6.0 or higher) or Microsoft Explorer (Version 5.0 or higher).</P>
        <P class=outTitle1>9. DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY</P>
        <P class=outTitle2>
          All data saved using the Service resides on ScholarMate servers which are hosted at an off-site location that
          is monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Data backups are performed on a regular basis and stored in a
          separate location. <br />
          <br /> ScholarMate uses reasonable commercial efforts to protect the privacy of the data saved by users of
          the Service. Access to the data requires the use of a login name and password which ScholarMate monitors.
          Subscriptions are set up in such a way that, when possible, each user is also authenticated by IP address. The
          server does not have an ftp site or any email programs loaded so there are limited ways to access the server.
          <br />
          <br /> There will be occasions when users of the Service volunteer information about themselves.
          User-specific information volunteered in these instances is archived and may only be used by ScholarMate to
          contacts users about ScholarMate’ programs, services, products and feature releases. ScholarMate does not
          sell, rent or lease its user information to third parties. If users do not want ScholarMate to contact them,
          they may choose to “opt out,” and ScholarMate will respect that decision.
        </P>
