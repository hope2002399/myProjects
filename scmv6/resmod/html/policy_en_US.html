                                      Information we collect and how we use it: We offer a set of value-added services

                                          services, such as our services subscription or advertising programs, we also

                                              2） ScholarMate cookies - Like most websites, ScholarMate uses cookies and
                                              web log files to track site usage and trends, to improve the quality of
                                              our service, to customize your experience on ScholarMate. When you visit
                                              ScholarMate, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a
                                              string of characters - onto your computer that uniquely identifies your
                                              browser. We use cookies to help for improving the quality of our service
                                              to our valuable customers by storing user preferences and tracking user
                                              trends, for example, how users search their own or other scholarly work.
                                              Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset
                                              your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
                                              sent. However, some ScholarMate features and services may not function
                                              properly if your cookies are disabled. One type of cookie, known as a
                                              “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your ScholarMate
                                              account. The next time you visit the ScholarMate website, the persistent
                                              cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not
                                              need to log in before using the Services. In order to access or change any
                                              of your private information (like a credit card number) or to send a
                                              message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your
                                              password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Another
                                              type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a
                                              particular visit to the ScholarMate website. Session cookies expire after
                                              a short time or when you close your web browser.<BR><BR> 3）

                                                  whenever you visit a website. Our server may take logs on those
                                                  information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address,
                                                  browser type, browser language, date and time of your request and one
                                                  or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.<BR><BR>
